      <description>Whilst looking at some intermittent Azure DevOps pipeline failures recently, a colleague of mine realized that we were being throttled by various Azure APIs, mainly due to how inefficiently our PowerShell scripts were written.
You know the score, you need to enumerate a particular property from all of the storage accounts deployed within your tenant, so you end up quickly doing something along the lines of:
foreach ($subscription in Get-AzSubscription) { &amp;lt;# $subscription is the current item #&amp;gt; foreach ($storageAccount in Get-AzStorageAccount) { &amp;lt;# $storageAccount is the current item #&amp;gt; $storageAccount.</description>

      <description>OK, so this mindmap is mental (unless you enjoy a good zoom in-and-out) - but i&amp;rsquo;ll break down each exam objective into sections, which may make it more consumable&amp;hellip;
